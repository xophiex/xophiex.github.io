      <description>Goddamn this toothache! It&amp;rsquo;s not even a cavity. It&amp;rsquo;s like there&amp;rsquo;s a direct highway between hell and the left side of my brain.</description>

      <description>I am so tired. I need to sleep. But I need to write here. Something or the other. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of fun to write anything. Just random words alskfjlskjflkflskdjf. Hehe.</description>

      <title>What to Write</title>

      <description>I have no idea what to write. So whenever I think that I have nothing to write, I&amp;rsquo;ll simply write that I have nothing to write. After all what I write doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to have any purpose. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what the next sentence will be. Tuna sandwich tastes so good!
It seems like I just like to use blogs and especially static blog frameworks like Hugo to simply fiddle around.</description>

      <title>Freedom of Self Expression</title>

      <description>For me to write here continuously is difficult because I am afraid of expressing myself openly. I think for most people under normal circumstances they have little to hide. But this has never been the case for me. However, I now feel that since that is past and I do have a strong sense of being my own person now, I should express myself freely.</description>

      <description>I want to be Xophie Moon so badly. I feel like this is my identity but I cannot use it in my life because I haven&amp;rsquo;t come out yet. But I mustn&amp;rsquo;t fall into self pity. My dreams are close at hand and why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I be Xophie Moon! Who determines who I am but me?</description>

      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just keep on writing whatever comes to my mind. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s that I am super casual about writing here.</description>
